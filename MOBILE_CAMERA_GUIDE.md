# 📱 Mobile Camera Access Guide

## The Problem
Modern mobile browsers require **HTTPS** to access camera and microphone when connecting from external IP addresses (like `http://10.181.172.168:3000`). This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive device features.

## The Solution
We've implemented several solutions to enable camera access on mobile devices:

### 1. 🔐 HTTPS Development Server
- Updated React to serve over HTTPS
- Added HTTPS support for external device access
- Camera permissions will work properly over secure connection

### 2. 📋 Smart Permission Guide
- Added intelligent camera permission detection
- Device-specific instructions for iOS and Android
- Clear steps to enable camera access in mobile browsers

### 3. 🛠️ Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages for permission issues
- Fallback options when camera access fails
- User-friendly troubleshooting tips

## 🚀 How to Start the Servers

### Option 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start_dev_servers.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd kusanyikoo
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend with HTTPS
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 📱 Mobile Access Instructions

1. **Connect to Same Wi-Fi**: Ensure your mobile device is on the same network as your development machine

2. **Access via HTTPS**: Open your mobile browser and go to:
   ```
   https://10.181.172.168:3000
   ```

3. **Accept Security Certificate**: 
   - You'll see a security warning (normal for development)
   - Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to 10.181.172.168 (unsafe)"
   - This is safe for local development

4. **Grant Camera Permissions**:
   - When prompted, click "Allow" for camera access
   - If no prompt appears, check browser permissions manually

## 🔧 Browser-Specific Instructions

### iOS Safari
1. Tap the `aA` icon in the address bar
2. Select "Website Settings"
3. Enable "Camera" permission

### Android Chrome
1. Tap the 🔒 lock icon in the address bar
2. Select "Permissions"
3. Allow "Camera" access

### Alternative Solutions
- 💻 Use desktop browser for camera features
- 📁 Upload photos from device gallery instead
- 🌐 Access via `localhost:3000` on the development machine

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. Open the member registration form
2. Click "Take Photo" button
3. If camera permission guide appears, follow the instructions
4. Grant camera permissions when prompted
5. Camera preview should now work

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "This site can't be reached"
- Check if both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Verify the IP address `10.181.172.168` is correct
- Try accessing `http://10.181.172.168:8000/api/health/` to test backend

### Camera Still Not Working
1. Try refreshing the page
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check if another app is using the camera
4. Use browser developer tools to check for errors

### HTTPS Certificate Issues
- This is normal for development
- You must accept the "unsafe" certificate
- Consider using `mkcert` for trusted local certificates in production
